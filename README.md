# TheCave [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/InfinityPhase/CaveAdventure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/InfinityPhase/CaveAdventure)
A text-adventure game

Pretty simple, what it says on the tin.
It is a little adventure where you controll a charater.
Nothing much.

## Note
Oh wow, is this old. This was the first time I had tried to use Java, with no idea of how to actually use the language.
If you read, or run, this program, you will quickly find it is horrible in design and execution.
I'm leaving it here though, because I think it was a valuable part of my experience in learning, as silly as that sounds.

Enjoy. Or don't.
